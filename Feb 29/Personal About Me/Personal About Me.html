<h2> About Me </h2>

<p><img src="Corin Menuge.jpeg"alt="Corin Menuge"></p>

<p>At the ripe, old age of 22, Corin has done a hell of a lot and he's really effing important. He promises: he is really, effing, important. Like omg... He has a job, he has more than one friend, AND he's really tall. Also fellas, line up: this one's single. ;)</p>

<p>Sometimes Corin writes really effing deep quotes in his spare time, and this is one of them, "I often walk through the Valley of Self-Loathing on the way to becoming a better person. Thus, negative emotion doesn't have to be only negative in impact." </p>
