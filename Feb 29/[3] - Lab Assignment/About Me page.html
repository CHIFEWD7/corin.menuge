<p><img src="Betty-White.jpg"alt="Betty White"></p>

<p>The series revolves around four older, single women (three widows and one divorc&eacute;e) sharing a house in Miami, Florida. The owner of the house is a widow named Blanche Devereaux (Rue McClanahan), who was joined by fellow widow Rose Nylund (Betty White) and divorc&eacute;e Dorothy Zbornak (Bea Arthur). They both responded to a room-for-rent ad on the bulletin board of a local grocery store. In the pilot episode, the women had a gay cook named Coco (Charles Levin), who was subsequently removed.[5] The three were soon joined by Dorothy's mother, Sophia Petrillo (Estelle Getty), after the retirement home where she lived, Shady Pines, burned down.[6][7]</p>
